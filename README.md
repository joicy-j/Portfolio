Hi, my name is Joicy.
<p>I am an aspiring data analyst with a great passion for solving problems. I am deeply interested in technology and have a strong enthusiasm for learning to code. I enjoy working with data and creating visual stories with numbers and data. Additionally, I am known as a good explainer and enjoy teaching others.</p>

## Optimization Of Machine Downtime
<p>
<a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1raLF3iwDgwJcbO1KUrxwr9dvt8a9AXqN/view?usp=drive_link">
In this project, I implemented a machine learning model for optimizing machine downtime. </a> </p>
<p> The project was conducted as part of my final year postgraduate internship. In this project a machine learning model was created using python which achieved an accuracy of 98%. The RandomForestClassifier algorithm was selected for its ability to handle complex datasets with non-linear relationships and its robustness to overfitting. Utilizing advanced analytical techniques in Python, trends and patterns were uncovered, enriching strategic decision-making processes. </p>
<p> Files to the project are available  <a href="https://github.com/joicy-j/joicy-s_portfolio/tree/31e943439e0c8402396ebe2e6b2d213c954a3720/Optimizing%20Machine%20Downtime"> here. </a> </p>

<p>
<a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1VCZMU4xLUW4VDcXWM5SgYVpNojV6ggLq/view?usp=sharing">
This project analyzed climatic trends over a period of five years to provide insights and analyze changes.</a></p>
<p> Sirumalai is a hill ecosystem situated in TamilNadu, India. This study thoroughly examines climatic nuances, meticulously analysing meteorological data spanning five years from 2018-2022.</p>
<p> Climatic Data was collected from online data repositories, pre-processed and cleaned. Data was analyzed using Correlation and visualization(using times series histogram and plots) to understand yearly trends in climate data using Microsoft Excel. </p>

# Visualizations

<p>These are some of the visualizations that I have done using Excel, Tableau and PowerBI. I believe that visuals help data to tell stories which it could never speak before. So visualization is an important part of analytics to communicate finidings to other stakeholders..</p>

## Visualization on Employee Attrition Using Excel and PowerBI

<p align="center"> <img src="images/HR_Excel.png"> <br> Visualization using Excel </p>
<p align="center"> <img src="images/HR_PowerBI.png"> <br> Visualization using PowerBI </p>
<p> Both visualizations are dynamic and help us to understand the rate of attrition in a company and how it affects different departments of the company. The visualization in Excel uses the help of PivotTables to add connections between graphs and filters, but for PowerBI those features were readily available. </p>
<p> </p>
<p> Files to the visualization are available  <a href="https://github.com/joicy-j/joicy-s_portfolio/tree/38c82fdcda8921084404db7c05165f9d6ba063d7/Attrition"> here. </a> </p>

<p> Here, Pivot Tables and Plots were used in Excel to anaylse data section wise, and interpretations were noted down for each tabke.</p>
<p>In Tableau a dynamic dashboard was create with same dataset to provide an idea on the overall situation.</p>
<p> Files to the visualization are available  <a href="https://github.com/joicy-j/joicy-s_portfolio/tree/38c82fdcda8921084404db7c05165f9d6ba063d7/Recritment"> here. </a> </p>

## Visualization on Stock Market Data Using PowerBI

<p align="center"> <img src="images/Stockmarket_PowerBI.png"> <br> Dashboard on PowerBI </p>
<p> This is a smaller project I did by downloading a dataset on stockmarket of companies and using PowerBI to create a dynamic dashboard that helps in comapring the companies based on different variables. </p>
